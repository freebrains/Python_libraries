I've learned Python libraries  for Data Science: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciKit-Learn. Also I've learned about probability theory and mathematical statistics (basic information).

## During this course I've learned about:
  * Calculations in Numpy. Working with data in Pandas ([Lesson 1](https://github.com/freebrains/Python_libraries/tree/Lesson_1))
  * Data visualization in Matplotlib ([Lesson 2](https://github.com/freebrains/Python_libraries/tree/Lesson_2))
  * Supervised learning in Scikit-learn ([Lesson 3](https://github.com/freebrains/Python_libraries/tree/Lesson_3))
  * Unsupervised learning in Scikit-learn ([Lesson 4](https://github.com/freebrains/Python_libraries/tree/Lesson_4))
  * Data analysis and statistical hypothesis testing.
